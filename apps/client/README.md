This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Create the client environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The example configures the backend endpoints through a shared host:

```env
NETWORK=localhost
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://${NETWORK}:8080"
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL="ws://${NETWORK}:8080/ws"
```

Set `NETWORK` to the backend computer's LAN IP when opening the client from another device. Then run the development
server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

YouTube queue entries use the official IFrame Player API and require no additional environment variables. Browsers
may require each participant to click **Enable playback** once before synchronized playback can start. The browser
must be able to reach `youtube.com`, and the video must be available and embeddable for that participant. YouTube
playback is best-effort because ads, buffering, keyframe seeking, and autoplay policies can introduce drift. Iframe
audio cannot use Beatsync's Web Audio low-pass filter.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
